/**
 * Write a Java program that gauge the rate of 
 * inflation for the past year. The program asks 
 * for the price of the item both one year ago and today. 
 * It estimates the inflation rate as the difference 
 * in price divided by the year ago price. Define a 
 * function to compute the rate of inflation. 
 * The inflation rate should be a value of type 
 * double giving the rate as a percent, 
 * for example 5.3 for 5.3%. Also print out the 
 * estimated price of the item in one and in two years 
 * from the time of the calculation. The increase in 
 * cost over one year is estimated as the inflation rate 
 * times the price at the start of the year. 
 * Define a second function to determine the estimated 
 * cost of an item in one year, given the current price 
 * of the item and the inflation rate as arguments.
